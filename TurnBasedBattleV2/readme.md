#Turn based battle system v2.0

This is a redo of my first turn based battle system. The following are my goals in making this system again:
 - Better cohesion: instead of putting everything in battle.j, everything should go where it makes sense to go
 - Better ability selection: floating text instead of dummy unit
 - Make it easier to implement skills/units/ai/etc.: it takes ages to do this right now
 
 Currently, system is INCOMPLETE.
 More documentation will be added on how to use it upon completion.
