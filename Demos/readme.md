# Demos
These are some basic demos for how to use the vjass language. This is to teach beginners the syntax of vjass.

Note that there is some bad practice here. For example, in real code functions will be declared private, and named constants will be used.
These have been avoided for now to not bog down the basic code with complex topics.
