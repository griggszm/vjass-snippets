# Position

Provides a library to use position functions with vjass coordinates. Usually, the PolarProjection and other functions only take locations. This redoes those functions to use x/y coordinates. Can also directly polar project a unit, with an option to get blocked by destructibles or not.
Implements: 
- PolarProject for x, y units
- Distance between coords
- Angle between coords
